    "text": "Some computational biologists have strong feelings about UMAPs. Often, these are well justified strong feelings, but the reasoning behind them can get mathy quickly. Like any other visualization tool, UMAPs may be used to support a data story - and you should use them with purpose.\nHere, I will explain some intuition behind where I think a UMAP belongs in a paper, and I‚Äôll do it with no math.\nMy aim is to address uncertain scientists who feel they‚Äôre creating a UMAP because that‚Äôs what other papers similar to the one they‚Äôre trying to write have done. Hopefully be the end of reading you will have confidence in your choice to include, or not include a UMAP in your manuscript."

    "text": "Parameters\nThere are two parameters which matter to me: n_neighbors and min_dist. In my head these are the ‚Äúspreadiness‚Äù and the ‚Äúsquishiness‚Äù parameters respectively. Some UMAP packages call these parameters a and b.\nAndy Coenen and Adam Pearce have a fantastic demo illustrating how these parameters interact. More or less: n_neighbors determines how far away members of different clusters will fall and min_dist controls how dense points in the same or similar clusters appear.\nCritically: as the author you pick the parameters. You are in effect drawing a cartoon version of your data, and you are in control of what it looks like. Of course we shouldn‚Äôt interpret these plots literally! Try to pick your parameters such that the relative sizes of clusters are generally represented by the amount of space they take up in your plot.\nOn the flip side, it‚Äôs okay to choose a UMAP that appeals to you and supports the story you are telling. As long as you investigate your hypotheses with other orthogonal analyses, no science crimes have been committed by choosing the nicest looking UMAP."

It doesn‚Äôt matter, this is a Venn diagram.\nAre you trying to visualize RNA velocity, pseudotime, cellular differentiation, or other methods which connect clusters together or have some sense of continuity between them? I suggest you try PHATE. This method is similar to UMAP in some ways, but has a tendency to make lines and tree-shapes instead of blobs. If you have a reason to believe that your data is closer to a series of related datapoints, rather than a collection of semi-related clusters, then PHATE may be a better match for that prior."

    "text": "Results\nThe first thing I tried was to ask it to be more concise, and try to give it a ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù which would be precise, correct, snappy, and basically replace searching on stackoverflow.\n\nYou are a very smart intellectual who doesn‚Äôt want to waste time explaining things. Keep responses short and to the point\n\nThis personality turned out to be kind of arrogant, and it wasn‚Äôt even always that correct. Perhaps a little too similar to stackoverflow üòÇ\nNext, I went simpler: restricted answers to be shorter\n\nAnswer in 3 sentences.\n\nThese answers were closer to what I wanted, but tended to cheat for more length by responding in huge run-on sentences.\nPotential downside (pointed out to me by Adamo): Possibly answer quality is befitting from chain-of-thought approach that these long answers generally follow. ChatGPT is probably saving me a lot of writing and explaining myself by self-prompting with appropriate context and step-by-step outlines for itself, even if I don‚Äôt need it.\nI also noticed that with custom instructions enabled, it seems that answers are less likely to make use of web search and supplying specific citations, and also less frequently generate code which executes within the interface.\nI‚Äôm currently on the following:\n\nRespond in at most 20 words. if you are prompted for code, such as with key words ‚Äúpython‚Äù, ‚Äúsklearn‚Äù, ‚Äúrstats‚Äù, ‚Äúdplyr‚Äù, ‚Äúggplot‚Äù etc, then give a snippet in addition to the 20 words but do not explain what it does.\n\nWhich seems to be quite useful, but I feel a bit like I stifled ChatGPTs creativity in expression. Any guilt I feel about this can be quickly be resolved, because the custom instruction looses its effect after a few interactions. Poems created as the first response respect the 20 word rule, but after a few back and forth chats, I can get a much longer result.\n\n\n\nLovely poem, thanks ChatGPT"

    "section": "How it works",
    "text": "How it works\n\n1. Each activity entry is read in from my CV spreadsheet.\nI add to this spreadsheet whenever I do something (whether it‚Äôs particularly notable or not). I have found that there are several activities that I have participated in which, at the time I didn‚Äôt think much of but in retrospect were really useful to me in building a record of continued enthusiasm.\nFor example, I didn‚Äôt used to think that the volunteering I did in various mentorship programs was all that interesting - it was just ‚Äúsomething I do on the side‚Äù.  These days, I actively identify myself as a mentor. The spreadsheet is an easy way to recognize the contribution I‚Äôve made and encourages me to keep contributing.Perhaps a glimpse of my tendency to dismiss my own work :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CV spreadsheet is an excellent tool.\n\n\n\nI think even if you don‚Äôt use any of the automations I describe here, and choose to manually curate a CV in word or latex, you should consider keeping a CV spreadsheet for yourself.\n\n\nThe CV spreadsheet includes some checkboxes, so that each activity can be included or excluded from the different outputs I might want: my website homepage, my long form CV, my short form CV.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of CV spreadsheet\n\n\nOnce read into R, these checkboxes become boolean variables, and I can simply subset the whole CV dataframe to relevant entries as follows:\ncv_entries &lt;- cv_entries %&gt;% filter(website_show == T)\nSee an example of this on my homepage qmd\nThis achieves desiderata (i): Easy to add and remove activities.\nI do some data manipulation at this point. For example any activity that has an end date in the future is changed to ‚Äúpresent‚Äù. When the end date passes, this is automatically changed to the date once re-rendered. This is nice because it means you can put an estimated future end date and the entry doesn‚Äôt have to be manually updated once it passes.\n\n\n2. Filtering\nEach section is created by filtering to the relevant activity type:\ncv_entries %&gt;% filter(type=='education') %&gt;% print_section()\nBecause I filter and render everything all together, I get desiderata (ii) for free: website and CV are always synced because they draw from the same data source at the same time. However, because of the filtering I can customize their contents and they don‚Äôt have to be identical.\n\n\n3. Format\nI do some cheeky formatting to make link buttons appear nicely and put everything into custom CSS classes, using the script format_entries.R.\nAlthough Quarto can simultaneously render html and PDF output, I had trouble creating a single .qmd file which could look nice in both formats. The approach I took instead was to use CSS to display entries differently depending on whether it was displayed on a screen, or printing. The process to create the PDF version is to first render to html, then print from browser.\nThis part was labour-intensive to figure out, and maybe not the best possible use of Quarto. I had to muck around with margins and invisible elements a little to get this to work. But I‚Äôm happy with the result! We achieved desirata (iii): Looks nice online and in print üòÅ\n\n\nQuirks\nSometimes pagebreaks are awkwardly placed in the middle of a CV entry. To resolve this, I open up the browser developer tools and insert some &lt;br&gt; until I‚Äôm satisfied. This is inelegant, but an acceptable inconvenience for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwkward pagebreak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit html to add loads of breaks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew spacing in PDF\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two things I format differently from the rest: ‚ÄúService‚Äù, which I squish all into one line to save space, and ‚ÄúPublications‚Äù, which on my CV pages I pull out of a .bib file and print using the RefManageR package. On my website homepage, I treat publications as a regular entry. I do this so that the online presentation can use the nice buttons that format_entries.R provides, and the print version contains the whole formatted reference.\nThe drawback of this is that I have to keep track of publications in two places, my CV spreadsheet and my .bib file. This isn‚Äôt the end of the world since publications are updated less frequently. I‚Äôm considering replacing this entirely with data pulled off google scholar, but I haven‚Äôt found a great way to do this yet. (Maybe the scholar package? Not entirely clear how I would annotate these with links to code, data, etc.)"

They are less obviously invested in your success, but there may be less pressure on you because of this. A grad student is your direct supervisor, and you may work closely with them on their research. In this environment you will have more autonomy, but you will have to be proactive in order to learn. Watch out for feeling isolated or forgotten.\nObviously the Hands-on PI / Hands-off PI labels are not all-encompassing, and most people will fall somewhere in between the two caricatures. Every environment will have its own peculiarities, advantages, and challenges.\nIn all cases you will most likely have a chance to interact with grad students or technical staff.

She was patient, supportive, and skilled at explaining complicated concepts in biology and programming. As a mentor, she has a great sense of when to guide you through a problem and when to let you work through challenges on your own. She helped me grow as a researcher and writer and I‚Äôm grateful for everything I learned from her.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúAs a mentor, Caitlin has greatly enhanced my ability to conduct research. She also provided valuable resources and aimed to make sure that I understood the fundamental concepts behind all the research conducted by breaking down difficult principles into easily comprehensible statements and thoughts. Additionally, she helped me find any sources of error as the research progressed. I enjoyed researching under her guidance, and I had an overall positive experience.‚Äù"

    "text": "Over the last year, I asked several of my mentors this question:\n\nWhat makes for a truly excellent grad student?\n\nI highly recommend you put this question to the people in your life that you work with, and admire. So far, I‚Äôve received several thoughtful answers, but the question often seems to takes people by surprise. This seems funny to me and it made me realize that although a lot of grad students seem to be concerned with ‚Äúam I doing a good job?‚Äù they aren‚Äôt asking for help on how to do a good job.\n\n\nObviously you can substitute ‚Äúgrad student‚Äù with whatever your current position is. I think this is a valuable question in general for getting perspective on what skills and behaviours you should be investing your time into.\nHere are some of my favourite responses:\n\nThey read a lot. They survey the field and have a good understanding of what‚Äôs out there and how their work fits within the context of the research landscape, and how their work is driving the field forward.\nThey are someone who focuses on what the big-picture impact of their project is, and thinks about the ultimate results and their significance.\nThey are a good communicator. They can write clearly, and they can explain their ideas.\nThey know how to make use of their advisor. Often, there are things that an advisor knows a simple answer to, that students don‚Äôt find out about just because they didn‚Äôt ask."

You will probably have to apply several years in a row before you have a good grasp on the language to use to describe your problem, and build a strong understand where your work fits within the field as a whole.\nLuckily, the easiest thing to work off of is your own past writing. If you start early, you will become a valuable resource to your future self üòÅ\n\n\nGet writing help\nMany universities have a writing center, with workshops aimed at specific scholarships. Look into their calendar ahead of time, as you‚Äôll get the most out of it if you can bring a draft with you.\n\n\nGet someone else to read it\nBonus points if they are not in your field, and are able to grasp your research proposal enough to get excited about your problem.

    "text": "An algorithm to write to\nI use this same process for both technical writing, and personal statements. This is what works for me personally: take what you like and ignore the rest üòä\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI am writing this in 2022. The specific formatting instructions might have changed since then. Never listen to anyone about presentation standards, except the official instructions.\n\n\nDo the following things in this order:\n\nSet up page margins to 2cm\nSet font to 12pt Arial\nWrite the title and your name in the header. Don‚Äôt forget to paginate where appropriate.\nPaste the instructions into the document, anything that gives guidelines on what the content should be. Check back on these as you write, especially if you get stuck on what to write about.\nWrite a bullet point outline of all the ideas you want to include (past/present/future work, practical implementation, etc)\nWrite statement-style headers for each section, in a way that captures the narrative flow of the story. These headers should be written such that they are sufficient that someone reading them could explain your whole project, even though you haven‚Äôt written the content yet. Put them in bold.\nAssign the bullet points to headers. These will guide how you flush out the body text.\nWrite the content paragraphs. Don‚Äôt worry about writing them in order. If you have trouble making progress on one, write a brief skeleton the best you can, and move on to a different section. The headers from step 5 will give you a strong sense of which chunks of text are self-contained.\nEdit. Go back to any paragraphs that are not flowing correctly. Use a read-aloud service (ex. in Word) to listen to your draft.\nRealize you‚Äôre about 20% over the page limit. Change font to 12pt Times New Roman. Now you‚Äôre done.\n\n\n\nSteps 5 & 6 should only contain sentence fragments and ideas that are easy to write. Do not spend time agonizing over wording in these steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nI learned #6 by reading other people‚Äôs examples. Done correctly, your headers will greatly improve readability. Ultimately you want your writing to be as skimmable as possible. This is important, because your application will be one of a large number of others that reviewers will have to read through.\n#10 is also a critical trick for me: always draft in Arial before finalizing to Times New Roman. TNR is much more condensed, and this font conversion will gift you extra space, as long as you don‚Äôt start by writing in it. I tend to over-write, and this trick helps me avoid having to spend a lot of time cutting content.\nWhen it comes to getting the exact wording you want, don‚Äôt let perfect be the enemy of progress. When you get stuck on a word:\n\nUse a thesaurus\nLook at other writing samples (some of mine are available here)\nWrite down a few synonyms of the word you‚Äôre trying to find as a note to self and come back to it later."

Don‚Äôt feel bound to what I describe here, if your writing heart leads you elsewhere\n\n\nThere are a few points in this structure that are subtly distinct. You should not just paraphrase the same sentence twice for these, which is a pitfall I‚Äôve run into. I have highlighted pairs of elements in this structure should not get conflated, because these elements have different roles in the proposal. Distinguish them from each other by changing the scope of what you describe.\n\nBackground and motivation\n\nWhere we are now (state of the field)\nWhat‚Äôs needed (key steps in new knowledge generation)\n\nObjectives and hypothesis\n\nWhat you‚Äôre developing (one-liner)\nWhat it will enable (big picture impact of your results)\n\nKnowledge gap (The direction your results will take the field in. Keep it large enough scale/scope that your project does not completely fill this gap, but maybe your project, plus 3-5 years more research would.)\nSignificance (Implications of what your project will enable)\nExperimental and theoretical approach\n\nSummary of 2-3 goals. Goals should describe the overarching themes of what your results will show.\n2-3 aims, with substeps that build to each aim. Aims should be actionable steps you will take, and build on each other logically, however later aims should not strictly rely on the success of earlier aims in order to be possible to execute. (What would you do if the early stuff didn‚Äôt work out? You don‚Äôt want to leave your proposal vulnerable to that question.)\n\nWhy you are uniquely positioned to execute the research here and now\n\n\n\nPitfalls\nThe biggest challenge for new grad students is not yet having a strong grasp on the state of their field, and how their project fits in that context.\n\nProbably your PI has a good idea of this, and your lab may have an overarching research story that you can tap into. Ask you PI for writing advice!\nThe only other thing you can do to improve on this is to read widely and engage with other researchers in your field. This is more of a student-lifestyle thing than it is writing advice, but it makes for a good researcher (and subsequently, research proposal).\n\n\n\nResearch contributions\nYour research contributions should include everything you did. This also means things that you had shared responsibility with others. (ex. put down writing if you wrote part of the original draft, even if someone else also wrote part). I recommend referring to CRediT taxonomy for a list and description of roles.\n\n\nRelevant Activities\nI treated this section as place to highlight my non-research CV items. They should ideally have some tie-in to your career goals, and speak to your attributes as a researcher. See Create a draft that harmonizes with your reference letters below."

I‚Äôve also authored some blog posts about analyzing how different hummingbirds visit the feeder.\n\nSee the project"

I used to use R Markdown, which was great for mixing text, images, \\(\\LaTeX\\), code, and (most importantly) emojis. However, over time my research notebook got bloated and trying to keep notes and also make sure everything rendered correctly became challenging.\nI moved to Notion because it offers a very similar experience for markdown lovers."

Every page can be a database and it‚Äôs pretty cool\nTemplates! I use the ‚Äúnew experiment‚Äù button to add structured entries to my lab notebook\nEvery page can be reformatted and nested on the fly\nI can sync TODOs across multiple pages: my main planner, and each project‚Äôs respective TODO list\nUseful shortcuts for Today‚Äôs date and cross referencing other pages\nThere are some cute templates out there\n\nAnd some gripes:\n\nNo offline mode - even for simple notes!\nSearch UI is not great: can‚Äôt search within code chunks, or toggle sections\nMarkdown exports are clunky and not everything will be well preserved (especially images)\nAdmiring cute templates feels productive, but it‚Äôs actually a massive time sink"

I pulled location data for 271 bee species from GBIF to create ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù maps.\nThis book can help junior taxonomists determine likely ID‚Äôs for bee specimens, and may be useful for understanding how bee populations have changed over time in the region.\n\nSee the project"

There‚Äôs loads of interesting marine life that lives around the cove, and when it‚Äôs warm the water glows at night with bioluminesence.\nThe Xettheccum ecocultural mapping team has done a really impressive job of putting together storytelling, ecological data, and elder‚Äôs knowledge of the area so it was an honour for me to collaborate with them and create the landing page for all their work to be displayed.\nOn the technical side, I played around with Quarto and learned more about accessible web principles, thanks to Dana at the OCAD Inclusive Design Research Center.\n\nSee the project"
