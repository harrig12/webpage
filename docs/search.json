    "text": "Over the last year, I asked several of my mentors this question:\n\nWhat makes for a truly excellent grad student?\n\nI highly recommend you put this question to the people in your life that you work with, and admire. So far, I’ve received several thoughtful answers, but the question often seems to takes people by surprise. This seems funny to me and it made me realize that although a lot of grad students seem to be concerned with “am I doing a good job?” they aren’t asking for help on how to do a good job.\n\n\nObviously you can substitute “grad student” with whatever your current position is. I think this is a valuable question in general for getting perspective on what skills and behaviours you should be investing your time into.\nHere are some of my favourite responses:\n\nThey read a lot. They survey the field and have a good understanding of what’s out there and how their work fits within the context of the research landscape, and how their work is driving the field forward.\nThey are someone who focuses on what the big-picture impact of their project is, and thinks about the ultimate results and their significance.\nThey are a good communicator. They can write clearly, and they can explain their ideas.\nThey know how to make use of their advisor. Often, there are things that an advisor knows a simple answer to, that students don’t find out about just because they didn’t ask."

    "section": "General advice",
    "text": "General advice\n\nUse a citation manager\nIf you’re not already using a citation management tool, then your life is harder than it needs to be. I use Zotero, but some people prefer Mendeley, or Paperpile, for example.\n\n\nI explain all the reasons I love Zotero here.\n\n\nDon’t expect to nail it on the first try.\nA common theme seems to be “I didn’t get any awards at all at first, then something clicked and I seemed to get them all at once”. You will probably have to apply several years in a row before you have a good grasp on the language to use to describe your problem, and build a strong understand where your work fits within the field as a whole.\nLuckily, the easiest thing to work off of is your own past writing. If you start early, you will become a valuable resource to your future self 😌\n\n\nGet writing help\nMany Universities have a writing center, with workshops aimed at specific scholarships. Look into their calendar ahead of time, as you’ll get the most out of it if you can bring a draft with you.\n\n\nGet someone else to read it\nBonus points if they are not in your field, and are able to grasp your research proposal enough to get excited about your problem. This is a good litmus test for writing clarity.\n\n\nAn algorithm to write to\nI use this same algorithm for both technical writing, and personal statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI am writing this in 2021. The specific formatting instructions might have changed since then. Never listen to anyone about presentation standards, except the official instructions.\n\n\nDo the following things in this order:\n\nSet up page margins to 2cm\nSet font to 12pt Arial\nWrite the title and your name in the header. Don’t forget to paginate where appropriate.\nPaste the instructions into the document, anything that gives guidelines on what the content should be. Check back on these as you write, especially if you get stuck on what to write about.\nWrite a bullet point outline of all the ideas you want to include (past/present/future work, practical implementation, etc)\nWrite statement-style headers for each section, in a way that captures the narrative flow of the story. These headers should be written such that they are sufficient that someone reading them could explain your whole project, even though you haven’t written the content yet. Put them in bold.\nAssign the bullet points to headers. These will guide how you flush out the body text.\nWrite the content paragraphs. Don’t worry about writing them in order. If you have trouble making progress on one, write a brief skeleton the best you can, and move on to a different section. The headers from step 5 will give you a strong sense of which chunks of text are self-contained.\nEdit. Go back to any paragraphs that are not flowing correctly. Use a read-aloud service (ex. in Word) to listen to your draft.\nRealize you’re about 20% over the page limit. Change font to 12pt Times New Roman. Now you’re done.\n\n\n\nSteps 5 & 6 should only contain sentence fragments and ideas that are easy to write. Do not spend time agonizing over wording in these steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nI learned #6 by reading other people’s examples. Done correctly, your headers will greatly improve readability. Ultimately you want your writing to be as skimmable as possible. This is important, because your application will be one of a large number of others that reviewers will have to read through.\n#10 is also a critical trick for me: always draft in Arial before finalizing to Times New Roman. TNR is much more condensed, and this font conversion will gift you extra space, as long as you don’t start by writing in it. I tend to over-write, and this trick helps me avoid having to spend a lot of time cutting content.\nWhen it comes to getting the exact wording you want, don’t let perfect be the enemy of progress. When you get stuck on a word:\n\nUse a thesaurus\nLook at other writing samples (some of mine are available here)\nWrite down a few synonyms of the word you’re trying to find as a note to self and come back to it later."

Don’t feel bound to what I describe here, if your writing heart leads you elsewhere\n\n\nThere are a few points in this structure that are subtly distinct. You should not just paraphrase the same sentence twice for these, which is a pitfall I’ve run into. I have highlighted pairs of elements in this structure should not get conflated, because these elements have different roles in the proposal. Distinguish them from each other by changing the scope of what you describe.\n\nBackground and motivation\n\nWhere we are now (state of the field)\nWhat’s needed (key steps in new knowledge generation)\n\nObjectives and hypothesis\n\nWhat you’re developing (one-liner)\nWhat it will enable (big picture impact of your results)\n\nKnowledge gap (The direction your results will take the field in. Keep it large enough scale/scope that your project does not completely fill this gap, but maybe your project, plus 3-5 years more research would.)\nSignificance (Implications of what your project will enable)\nExperimental and theoretical approach\n\nSummary of 2-3 goals. Goals should describe the overarching themes of what your results will show.\n2-3 aims, with substeps that build to each aim. Aims should be actionable steps you will take, and build on each other logically, however later aims should not strictly rely on the success of earlier aims in order to be possible to execute. (What would you do if the early stuff didn’t work out? You don’t want to leave your proposal vulnerable to that question.)\n\nWhy you are uniquely positioned to execute the research here and now\n\n\n\nPitfalls\nThe biggest challenge for new grad students is not yet having a strong grasp on the state of their field, and how their project fits in that context.\n\nProbably your PI has a good idea of this, and your lab may have an overarching research story that you can tap into. Ask you PI for writing advice!\nThe only other thing you can do to improve on this is to read widely and engage with other researchers in your field. This is more of a student-lifestyle thing than it is writing advice, but it makes for a good researcher (and subsequently, research proposal)."

As part of the requirements for that program, I took two research project courses; BCB330 and BCB430. There are many similar courses offered through a variety of programs, such as ROPs, capstone projects, independent research projects, etc. Most of these are blank-cheque style courses you get credit for by working with a professor in a research capacity.\nSometimes you can get a paid research position supported by a USRA grant.

    "text": "What to expect in the research environment\nI divide labs into two categories: Hands-on PI / Hands-off PI A Hands-on PI is a professor who has a lot of time for you, but may have high expectations on your research output. Although you may be working with a grad student, this PI could be directly involved in your project and giving you guidance. This environment might be stressful, but you’ll probably learn a lot. Watch out for unreasonable demands.\nHands-off PI has seen it all. Their group is large, and they might not make time to meet with you. They are less obviously invested in your success, but there may be less pressure on you because of this. A grad student is your direct supervisor, and you may work closely with them on their research. In this environment you will have more autonomy, but you will have to be proactive in order to learn. Watch out for feeling isolated or forgotten.\nObviously the Hands-on PI / Hands-off PI labels are not all-encompassing, and most people will fall somewhere in between the two caricatures. Every environment will have its own peculiarities, advantages, and challenges.\nIn all cases you will most likely have a chance to interact with grad students or technical staff. You will get to attend group meetings (usually weekly), and possibly be expected to present your work to the lab at group meeting."

    "text": "How are research courses graded?\nIn general the grading for research project courses is relatively lax. Often there is a performance evaluation that your supervisor has to fill out at the end, plus some written or presentation-based deliverable for you to submit.\nMany labs will grade you based on your improvement, and you’ll get a good grade as long as you show up regularly and put effort in to learning."

    "text": "Your research output\nThere are several undergraduate poster days run by various departments, often associated with their respective project courses.\nMost of the summer programs I mentioned above have their own dedicated “research day” at the end of the summer.\nIf this kind of poster day isn’t available to you, one thing you can do at the end of a research experience is to submit to an undergraduate journal or conference. Leave a couple weeks at the end of your research experience for developing a write-up or poster, and ask your mentor for input. With an end product that you deliver in someway to an audience, you will gain more out of your experience, and make it easier to put on your CV.\nSome examples of research-focused UofT student publications:\n\nArbor Journal of Undergraduate Research (The ASSU also hosts an annual undergraduate research conference)\nJULS Journal of Undergraduate Life\nRUCS Review of Undregraduate Computer Science\n\nYou can also apply to have your research appear in similar venues at other universities, or if you’re particularly ambitious, grab some friends and host your own research day 🌈"
