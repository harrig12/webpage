    "contents": "\r\nOver the last year, I have been asking various people this question:\r\n\r\nWhat makes for a truly excellent grad student?\r\n\r\nI highly recommend you put this question to the people in your life that you work with, and admire. So far, I’ve recieved thoughtful answers, but the question often seems to takes people by surprise. This is funny to me because it makes me think that although a lot of grad students seem to be concerned with getting feedback on “am I doing a good job?” they aren’t asking for help on how to do a good job. Here are some of my favourite responses from the people I asked:\r\n\r\nObviously you can substitute “grad student” with whatever your position is. I think this is a valuable question for getting perspective on what skills and behaviours you should be investing your time into.\r\nThey read a lot. They survey the field and have a good understanding of what’s out there and how their work fits within the context of the research landscape, and how their work is driving the field forward.\r\nThey are someone who focuses on what the big-picture impact of their project is, and thinks about the ultimate results and their significance.\r\nThey are a good communicator. They can write clearly, and they can explain their ideas.\r\nThey know how to make use of their advisor. Often, there are things that an advisor knows a simple answer to, that students don’t find out about just because they didn’t ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThis article got posted in my lab’s slack. It claims the folowing:\r\n\r\nConventional wisdom in the laboratory sciences suggests that PhD students develop their research skills as a function of mentorship from their faculty advisors (i.e., principal investigators; PIs). However, no prior research has identified empirically a relationship between specific PI practices and the development of research skills. Here we show that PIs’ laboratory and mentoring activities do not significantly predict students’ skill development trajectories, but the engagement of postdocs and senior graduate students in laboratory interactions do. These findings support the practice of “cascading mentorship” as differentially effective and identify a critical but previously unrecognized role for postdocs in the graduate training process. They also illustrate both the importance and the feasibility of identifying evidence-based practices in graduate education.\r\n\r\nA postdoc in my lab responded, with their wisdom:\r\nuse tmux\r\nuse Snakemake\r\nuse Pycharm\r\nuse zsh\r\ndon’t use Jupyter Notebooks\r\nuse conda environments\r\nThis list has served me well so far. To add some wisdom of my own:\r\nalways write a readme\r\nuse wandb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
