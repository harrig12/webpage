I recently put together a website to act as a guidebook to bees documented in the Pacific Maritime region of British Columbia. 

All the bee images were curated by BC Master Melittologist, Kath Quayle with reference to several public and private collections. I pulled location data for 271 bee species from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) to create "last seen" maps. 

This book can help junior taxonomists determine likely ID's for bee specimens, and may be useful for understanding how bee populations have changed over time in the region.
