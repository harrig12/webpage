It's my second time organizing the [Toronto CS Graduate Application Assistance Program](https://sites.google.com/view/torontogaap) and it was a great experience!  

The program matches current Computer Science graduate students with prospective students, with a focus for those who are underrepresented in computing. We were able to provide application feedback to 55 mentees. 


Big thanks to the volunteers for their work `r emo::ji('sunflower')` we got lots of positive coments and grateful messages from mentees. 

I'm looking forward to running this program again next year!
