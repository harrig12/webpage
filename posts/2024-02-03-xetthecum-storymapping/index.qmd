I built a website for the [IMERSS ecocultural mapping project](https://floeproject.org/ecocultural-mapping-project/) of Retreat Cove on Galiano, BC. 

Retreat Cove (Xetthecum in the Hul’qumi’num language) has a special place in my heart because growing up I spent summers in the area. There's loads of interesting marine life that lives around the cove, and when it's warm the water glows at night with bioluminesence. 

Through this project, I got to learn about indigenous cultural values connected to the area. On the technical side, I played around with Quarto and got cozy with some accessible web principles, thanks to Dana at the [OCAD Inclusive Design Research Center](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/).


To put together the landing page, I used: 

* [quarto](https://quarto.org/) for the site
* [embedr](https://github.com/mccarthy-m-g/embedr) for embedding Hul’qumi’num audio 
* Modal dialogue box from [jimjamslam experiments](https://jimjam-slam.github.io/quarto-experiments/modal-dialog/)
