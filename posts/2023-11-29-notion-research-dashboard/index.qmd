I use notion to organize lots of things, in particular my research notes. I used to use R Markdown, which was great for mixing text, images, $\LaTeX$, code, and (most importantly) emojis. However, over time my research notebook got bloated and trying to keep notes and also make sure everything rendered correctly became challenging.  

I moved to Notion because it offers a very similar experience for markdown lovers.

## Thoughts on the experience 

Here's some things I like about it: 

* Cloud backed + mobile app
* All my notes are searchable
* Possible to export as markdown 
* Databases! Every page can be a database and it's pretty cool
* Templates! I use the "new experiment" button to add structured entries to my lab notebook
* Every page can be reformatted and nested on the fly
* I can sync TODOs across multiple pages: my main planner, and each project's respective TODO list
* Useful shortcuts for Today's date and cross referencing other pages
* There are some cute templates out there

And some gripes:

* No offline mode - even for simple notes!
* Search UI is not great: can't search within code chunks, or toggle sections 
* Markdown exports are clunky and not everything will be well preserved (especially images)
* Admiring cute templates feels productive, but it's actually a massive time sink
