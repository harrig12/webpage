	abstract = {Mutational signatures are patterns of mutation types, many of which are linked to known mutagenic processes. Signature activity represents the proportion of mutations a signature generates. In cancer, cells may gain advantageous phenotypes through mutation accumulation, causing rapid growth of that subpopulation within the tumour. The presence of many subclones can make cancers harder to treat and have other clinical implications. Reconstructing changes in signature activities can give insight into the evolution of cells within a tumour. Recently, we introduced a new method, TrackSig, to detect changes in signature activities across time from single bulk tumour sample. By design, TrackSig is unable to identify mutation populations with different frequencies but little to no difference in signature activity. Here we present an extension of this method, TrackSigFreq, which enables trajectory reconstruction based on both observed density of mutation frequencies and changes in mutational signature activities. TrackSigFreq preserves the advantages of TrackSig, namely optimal and rapid mutation clustering through segmentation, while extending it so that it can identify distinct mutation populations that share similar signature activities.},

	abstract = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell growth that integrates growth factor signaling and nutrient availability and is a downstream effector of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and PI3K/Akt signaling. Thus, activating mTOR mutations would be expected to enhance growth in many tumor types. However, tumor sequencing data has shown that mTOR mutations are enriched only in renal clear cell carcinoma, a clinically hypervascular tumor unlikely to be constrained by nutrient availability. To further define this cancer type-specific restriction, we studied activating mutations in mTOR. All mTOR mutants tested enhanced growth in a cell type agnostic manner under nutrient-replete conditions but were detrimental to cell survival in nutrient-poor conditions. Consistently, analysis of tumor data demonstrated that oncogenic mutations in the nutrient-sensing arm of the mTOR pathway display a similar phenotype and were exceedingly rare in human cancers of all types. Together, these data suggest that maintaining the ability to turn off mTOR signaling in response to changing nutrient availability is retained in most naturally occurring tumors.},

	abstract = {Cancer genomes harbor a catalog of somatic mutations. The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We present GenomeTrackSig as an extension to the TrackSig R package to construct regional signature profiles using optimal segmentation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 306 genomes contain at least one of 54 recurrent changepoints shared by seven or more genomes of the same tumor type. Five recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type and some, but not all, are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ABSTRACT{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The intestinal epithelium has an exceptional capacity to repair following injury, and recent evidence has suggested that YAP-dependent signaling was crucial for the expansion of \textit{Clu}$^{\textrm{+}}$ revival stem cells (revSCs) with fetal-like characteristics, which are essential for epithelial regeneration. However, neither the mechanism underlying where these revSCs emerge from nor the nature of the physiological cues that induce this revSC program, are clearly identified. Here, we first demonstrate that \textit{Alpk1} and \textit{Tifa}, which encode the proteins essential for the detection of the bacterial metabolite ADP-heptose (ADP-Hep), were expressed by the stem cell pool in the intestinal epithelium. Treatment of intestinal organoids with ADP-Hep not only induced acute NF-κB pro-inflammatory signaling but also TNF-dependent apoptosis within the crypt, causing blunted proliferation and acute disruption of the crypt architecture, while also triggering induction of a revSC program. To identify the molecular underpinnings of this process, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of ADP-Hep-treated organoids as well as lineage-tracing experiments. Our data reveal that ADP-Hep induced the specific ablation of the homeostatic intestinal stem cell (ISC) pool. Removal of ADP-Hep resulted in the rapid recovery of ISCs through dedifferentiation of Paneth cells, which transiently acquired revSC features and expressed nuclear YAP. Moreover, lineage tracing from \textit{Lyz1}$^{\textrm{+}}$ Paneth cells showed that ADP-Hep triggered Paneth cell de-differentiation towards pluripotent and proliferative cells in organoids. \textit{In vivo}, revSC emergence in response to irradiation-induced injury was severely blunted in \textit{Tifa}-deficient mice, suggesting that efficient epithelial regeneration in this model required detection of microbiota-derived ADP-Hep by the ALPK1-TIFA pathway. Together, our work reveals that Paneth cells can serve as the cell of origin for revSC induction in the physiological context of microbial stimulation, and that the transient loss of \textit{Alpk1}-expressing ISCs is the initiating event for this regenerative process.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Patients with Gleason pattern 4 or 5 prostate tumors have a high risk of biochemical recurrence and worse survival. Affected by their local environment, dynamic immune cell phenotypes can both hinder or drive cancer progression. To understand the proteomic environments that facilitate specific immune cell responses and interactions in advanced prostate cancer, we have spatially resolved the immune cell content and metabolic features of Gleason pattern 4 and 5 and subpatterns of prostate tumors. To scale quantitative multiplexed histopathology measurements to human disease, we have applied a new high-throughput whole slide modality of high-plex Imaging Mass CytometryTM to simultaneously quantify immune cells, metabolic states, prostate specific pathways, and biomarkers in 125 whole slide sections from 42 patients over 100 cm2 of tissue. It is essential to image whole slide sections in order to fully evaluate the complete heterogeneity of these cancer samples. In parallel, multi-region macrodissection shotgun proteomics and both glycan and extracellular matrix MALDI imaging mass spectrometry have quantified the proteome associated with specific immune cell environments. Together, we identify localized proteomic microenvironments associated with specific tumor supportive or inhibitory immune cell content in human tumors that may help differentiate which high-risk patients will have a rapid biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy.Citation Format: Jennifer L.
